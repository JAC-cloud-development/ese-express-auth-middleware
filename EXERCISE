install express 
=> npm install express

import the express module
=> import express from "express"

create an object from the express function which we contains methods for making requests and starting the server
=> const app = express();

tell our server to listen on port 3000 and when the server starts, run a callback function that console.log's a message

=> 
app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log(
    "The server has started on port 3000. Head to localhost:3000 in the browser and see what's there!"
  );
});

For this exercise we will be building a simple application where we will store a shopping list. You should use an array to store your items in the shopping list.
Our application should have the following routes:

GET /items - this should respond with a list of shopping items. // GIA' IMPLEMENTATA
POST /items - this route should accept form data and add it to the shopping list.
GET /items/:id - this route should display a single item's name and price
PATCH or PUT /items/:id - this route should accept edits to existing items.
DELETE /items/:id - this route should allow you to delete a specific item from the array.

Testare ogni route con POSTMAN
